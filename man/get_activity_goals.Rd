\description{
The Get Activity Goals retrieves a user's current daily or weekly activity goals using measurement units as defined in the unit system, which corresponds to the Accept-Language header provided.
Considerations
Only the current goals are returned.
Floors goal only returned for users who currently or have previously paired a Fitbit device with an altimeter.
Calories out goal represents either dynamic daily target from the Premium trainer plan or manual calorie burn goal.
The default daily goal values are:
10 floors
30 active minutes
Calories out is user specific, which accounts for BMR
