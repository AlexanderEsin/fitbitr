\description{
Returns the intraday time series for a given resource in the format requested. If your application has the appropriate access, your calls to a time series endpoint for a specific day (by using start and end dates on the same day or a period of 1d), the response will include extended intraday values with a one-minute detail level for that day. Unlike other time series calls that allow fetching data of other users, intraday data is available only for and to the authorized user.
